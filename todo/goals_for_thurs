This is a tracking file for minni benchmarks outside of feature requests.  (I'm using it as a short term file)

Architecture:
   We have redesigned and reimplemented architecuture for this course three times in the last four weeks, finally resting with an AWS implementation.
   In addition to the nagios server, much of our monitoring can be accomplished via an aws client
   Automation of the architecture is important, as is provisioning.  All accounts will need to be provisioned by next week
   Full automated reports due next week as well
   
Class Benchmarks:
   In addition to the Syllabus, students should have access to views of the quarter to come via the calander
   Will need to upload automation materials and excercises to canvas so students can work ahead if desired
   
  The scripting side of the class is well supported by the books, however systems administration should be more clearly outlined
  The *nix purple book is a good start.  Much of what we will be doing in this class needs to include both physical and VM infrastructure automation.

Text Books:
   Write out explicite assignments.  Right now I know where the chapters are but that doesn't help my students.
   There are also, likely, better assinments I can create after reviewing the chapter and encorparating a lecture
   
   
Deliverables:
  Syllabus intigrated with Canvas Calander outlining labs, assignments and weekly topics.
  Administrative scripting and reporting
